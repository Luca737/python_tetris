# python_tetris
This is my second go at making a Tetris game.
Now that I have a little more experience I wanted to redo this project and create an AI to play it for me.

I learned a lot about new Python constructs and my code was heavily influenced by _The Game of Code_ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3b1n1dXYYs&t=254s
